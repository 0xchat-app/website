        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><span class="highlight">XChat</span> employs cutting-edge security measures and end-to-end encryption technology to provide private messaging services to users worldwide ("Services"). Your private messages are always encrypted, meaning they can never be shared or viewed by anyone other than yourself and the intended recipients.</p>
        
        <h2>Information You Provide</h2>
        <h3>Account Information</h3>
        <p>XChat is built on the Nostr protocol. When you create a <span class="highlight">XChat</span> account, you locally generate a Nostr private key and a Nostr public key. The public key is used to provide our Services to you and other <span class="highlight">XChat</span> users. You can also choose to add other information to your account, such as a profile name and avatar. The private key is the only information that can access your account and must be kept secure by yourself. No third party, including XChat, can access your private key.</p>
        
        <h3>Local Encrypted Storage</h3>
        <p>In XChat, your private key is encrypted and stored in a local database, with the encryption database key stored in iOS Keychain for iOS devices and Android Keystore for Android devices.</p>
        
        <h3>No Data Collection</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">XChat</span> does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, technical data, or usage information. We operate on a zero-data collection principle, ensuring complete privacy for our users.</p>
        
        <h3>Messages &amp; Contacts</h3>
        <p><span class="highlight">XChat</span> uses Nostr MLS technology for encryption, ensuring that no third party can decrypt or access the content of your private messages and contacts. XChat only stores end-to-end encrypted messages on Nostr relays to deliver them to your device.</p>
        
        <h3>Circle Relay &amp; Relay Selection</h3>
        <p>XChat sends your encrypted messages to your configured circle relay. You have full control over your relay choice - you can select either public relays or private relays based on your privacy preferences. This flexibility allows you to balance between accessibility and privacy according to your specific needs.</p>
        
        <h3>Minimal Metadata Design</h3>
        <p>XChat adopts a minimal metadata design principle to minimize your privacy exposure as much as possible. Even when using public Nostr relays, your privacy is safely protected, preventing others from discovering your chat content, who you're chatting with, chat frequency, and other sensitive information.</p>
        
        <h3>Fully Open Source</h3>
        <p>XChat is fully open-source, which means the complete source code is publicly available for review and verification. This transparency ensures that our privacy and security claims can be independently audited by the community, providing you with confidence that your data is truly protected as described.</p>
        
        <h3>Managing Your Information</h3>
        <p>You can manage your personal information within <span class="highlight">XChat</span>'s application settings. For instance, you can update your profile information or choose to enable additional privacy features.</p>
        
        <h2>Updates</h2>
        <p>We will update this Privacy Policy as needed to ensure it remains current, accurate, and as clear as possible. Your continued use of our Services confirms your acceptance of any updated Privacy Policy.</p>
        
        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@0xchat.com" style="color: #a67efe; text-decoration: none;">support@0xchat.com</a></p>
